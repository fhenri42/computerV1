## What does it do.
* This code will solve x^0, x^1, x^2 equation you put in parameters.
* Your equation must always be well formated. Example: "8 * X^0 - 6 * X^1 + 0 * X^2 - 5.6 * X^2 = 3 * X^0.

## How to use it.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fhenri42/computerV1 && cd computerV1
go build main.go
./main "5 * X^0 + 4 * X^1 - 9.3 * X^2 = 1 * X^0"
```
